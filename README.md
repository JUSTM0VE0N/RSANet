we propose a novel recursive self-attention module (RSAM), which consists of two stages: spatial-spectral similarity extraction and self-attention weight generation. The proposed RSAM employs a global-to-local strategy to capture the global interdependencies of two distinct
local locations in the feature map. This method allows for simultaneous consideration of both spatial and spectral information while focusing on more mutual information between spectral and spatial dimensions.
