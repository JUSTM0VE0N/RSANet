We propose a novel __recursive self-attention module (RSAM)__, which consists of two stages: __spatial-spectral similarity extraction__ and __self-attention weight generation__. The proposed RSAM employs a __global-to-local strategy__ to capture the global interdependencies of two distinct local locations in the feature map. This method allows for simultaneous consideration of __both spatial and spectral information__ while focusing on __more mutual information__ between spectral and spatial dimensions.
